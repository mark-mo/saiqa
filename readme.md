This is the code for Sima: Artificial Intelligence for Question Answering.

Sima: Artificial Intelligence for Question Answering was originally created for the GCU 2018-2019 Computer Science Capstone.

Its intent is to both be a way to easily have questions answered, similar to other artificial intelligence like Alexa, and be able to have a growing knowledge base from which it can pull from.

The name Sima comes from the Greek letter Sigma which in this instance refers to a sum of its parts. As for the Greek letter Psi in the upper-left hand corner, this refers to how the letter can be pronounced SAI and refers to the mind in psychology

Current Modules:
  Login/Register: 90% Done [Able to login and register, need to handle several alternate paths]
  
  Classifier: 70% Done [Able to classify sentence with 18% accuracy.  Adding a Genetic Algorithm]
  
  Regex: 80% Done [Most cases handled, just needs to be implemented]
  
  Dynamic Memory Network: 90% Done [Able to answer a question, but outputs the first or last word it was given.]
  
  Data Access Layer: 70% Done [Database is in place and login/register implemented and able to store and retrieve sentences.  Still need to pull questions most frequently asked and random facts.]

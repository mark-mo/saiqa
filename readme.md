  Classifier: 50% Done [Able to classify sentence with 18% accuracy.  Needs a bigger dataset]
  
  Regex: 80% Done [Most cases handled, just needs to be implemented]
  
  Dynamic Memory Network: 60% Done [Have the ability to train architecture, need to separate code to be able to properly use the architecture]
  
  Data Access Layer: 50% Done [Database is in place and login/register implemented, need the Dynamic Memory Network and Classifier completed before fully implementing]
